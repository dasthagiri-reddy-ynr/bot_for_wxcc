main idea:
To provide Bot for Supervisors where they can perform multiple actions.

First implementation:
update global variables from the bot.



ignore the messages from bot logic:

after receiving the webhook notification from bot to the app.

we will get personEmail in the notification itself.

if the notification contains @webex.bot ignore the message.

me:tts prompt 
bot: Current Value at tts prompt is : 

me : Hi 
bot : Hello welcome to the wxcc supervisor bot.
      please select an option to start
      <List of options>
      Next button

me: select an option(Global Variable List)

Bot: Operation regarding the(List of Global Variable) and Next button.

Bot: shows the tts_script and its default value and next button.

bot: text box to enter the value for tts_script and update button.

bot: message with status.


differentiate between a incomming message and to the bot and a selction in the card.



sequence:

msg from user 1st msg notification
reply from bot with card 2nd attachment notification and 3rd notification as msg
submit the card 3rd notification
